## Instructions
* Up to 4 players compete to be the first to assemble and fuel their spaceship.
* Each player must collect their pieces of spaceship, which will then be automatically dropped when the player is above their construction zone.
* Once the main ship is built, it must be filled with fuel in the same way.
* The first to do this is the winner.


## Controls
* Keyboard: W, A, S, D and Space.
* Should work with most controllers
* Esc - quit


## Running on Linux
You will probably need to mark the program as an executable before Linux will allow you to run it.


## Running on a Mac
Since the app is not signed for a Mac (I don't even have a Mac), it shows "Application from unidentified developer" on first start.  Open you game with Ctrl+Right Click and then Open.  More details here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac
